//! Central registry of every OAuth scope the `gddy` CLI requests.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! A command declares the scopes it needs with
//! [`cli_engine::CommandSpec::with_scopes`], and
//! cli-engine's OAuth step-up mints a token carrying them. But a scope the CLI
//! *requests* is only grantable if the CLI's **OAuth client** is *registered* for
//! it — otherwise the authorization server refuses to mint a token carrying the
//! scope and the command fails at auth, with nothing in this codebase to catch
//! it. It is easy to add `.with_scopes(&["some.new:scope"])` to a command by
//! copying a neighbour and never realize the scope is unobtainable.
//!
//! So: **every scope the CLI uses is declared here, once**, and commands draw
//! from these constants rather than spelling out string literals. The [`ALL`]
//! slice is derived from the same declarations, so it is always the complete
//! list of `resource:action` *permission* scopes the OAuth client must be
//! registered for — a single place to diff against the client's configuration.
//!
//! `ALL` does NOT cover every scope requiring client registration, though:
//! directive scopes like [`OFFLINE_ACCESS`] aren't `resource:action` grants, so
//! they're declared outside [`declare_scopes!`]/`ALL` but still need the same
//! server-side registration. When syncing the OAuth client's configuration,
//! diff against `ALL` *plus* every such standalone constant, not `ALL` alone.
//!
//! # Adding a scope (READ THIS)
//!
//! 1. Add a constant to the [`declare_scopes!`] block below (or, for a directive
//!    scope that isn't a `resource:action` permission, declare it standalone
//!    like [`OFFLINE_ACCESS`]). Constants in `declare_scopes!` are automatically
//!    included in [`ALL`] — you cannot add one there without registering it in
//!    the list.
//! 2. Reference the new constant from the command via `.with_scopes(&[scopes::…])`.
//! 3. **Register the same scope on the CLI's OAuth client**, or it will be
//!    ungrantable at runtime.
//!
//! This registry covers the scopes the CLI requests for *itself* (login defaults
//! plus per-command step-up). It intentionally does NOT cover scopes that are
//! user data rather than the CLI's own grants — e.g. the `authorizationScopes`
//! assigned to a third-party app created via `gddy platform app init`, or the
//! ad-hoc scopes `gddy api call --scope …` derives from the API catalog at
//! runtime.

/// Declares each scope constant and derives [`ALL`] from the same list, so a
/// scope cannot exist without being part of the authoritative registry.
