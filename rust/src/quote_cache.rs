//! Local cache of registration quotes, bridging `domain quote` → `domain purchase`.
//!
//! v3's `POST /registrations` needs more than the opaque `quoteToken`: it must
//! re-state the quote's `domain`, `period`, and `consent.agreementTypes` (which the
//! server cross-checks against the quote the token was minted for). The token is
//! opaque ("do not parse") and there is **no GET-quote endpoint**, so those values
//! can't be recovered from the token or re-fetched from the server. `domain quote`
//! therefore stashes the quote here and `domain purchase --quote-token` reads it
//! back — reuniting the token with the data the register body must echo, and
//! letting `purchase` charge the exact price that was reviewed.
//!
//! Entries are single-use: [`get`] reads a quote without consuming it (so the
//! `--agree` gate can show its terms before the user confirms), and [`remove`]
//! deletes it only after the registration succeeds. They also expire with the
//! token (~10 min), and expired entries are pruned whenever the cache is read
//! ([`get`]) or written ([`save`]) — so an abandoned quote's data (including a
//! serialized profile that may contain contact PII) doesn't linger past its
//! expiry once any later quote/purchase runs, and the file stays small. It
//! lives beside `contacts.toml`/`environments.toml`
//! (`dirs::config_dir()/gddy/quotes.json`); a quote token is a short-lived,
//! single-use capability, not a long-lived secret.
//!
//! (The domains team is being asked to add a `GET /registration-quotes/{token}`
//! route; if that lands, `purchase` could resolve the quote server-side and this
//! local cache could be retired.)
